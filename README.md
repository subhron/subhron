# Hi, I'm Subham!

I'm a seasoned professional with a diverse and dynamic background of over 5 years in technology, analytics, and product management with renowned companies such as Paytm, Indegene and Cognizant primarily in healthcare and fintech domains. Over the course of my career, I have demonstrated a consistent ability to conceptualize and develop products from inception, taking full ownership of the end-to-end product lifecycle. My proficiency also extends to leveraging data analytics to drive strategic decision-making and deliver unparalleled user experiences.

At Paytm, my role involves diving deep into data to understand user behavior and preferences, enabling us to refine and optimize our product offerings. I played a pivotal role in designing strategies for the Refunds and Cards team, focusing on improving user experiences, enhancing security measures, and ensuring seamless refund processes.

Prior to my role at Paytm, I worked as a lead Data Analyst at Indegene, where I spearheaded an in-depth analytics product experience for the Radicava Oral drug launch, specifically targeting the rare disease ALS. This encompassed a holistic analysis covering both pre-sales and post-sales phases. My role involved harnessing data-driven insights to guide strategic decision-making, optimize launch strategies, and ensure the delivery of superior patient outcomes and support in the realm of ALS treatment.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Management Information Systems from the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, expected to graduate in June 2024. This educational journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in leveraging technology for strategic business solutions. 

I'm passionate about leveraging technology to drive business growth and improve processes. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate to achieve our professional goals.
